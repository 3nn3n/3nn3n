## 👨‍💻 Summary
**Solana Engineer** passionate about building secure, efficient, and well-architected on-chain programs.  
I focus on PDAs, account security, SPL Token program flows, and writing clean on-chain logic with **Rust + Anchor**.  
I’ve built multiple real Solana programs end-to-end and I’m continuously learning deeper Solana internals.

# Projects

## 1. **Stake Program**
**Tech:** Rust, Anchor, SPL Token Program  

### **What it does**
A minimal stake pool where users can deposit tokens and earn proportional rewards.

### **Key Responsibilities**
- Designed PDA-based pool authority  
- Implemented secure staking & reward distribution  
- Created vault account to hold staked tokens  
- Wrote account validations & error handling  
- Added reward calculation logic  

### **Skills Demonstrated**
✔ PDA signer patterns  
✔ Vault authority design  
✔ Token transfers via CPI  
✔ Anchor validations

## 2. **On-Chain Vault System**
### **What it does**
A secure PDA-owned vault where users can deposit/withdraw fungible tokens.

### **Key Responsibilities**
- Designed PDA vault authority  
- Implemented deposit & withdrawal instructions  
- Secured all token CPI calls  
- Defined account constraints to prevent tampering  
- Designed access-control layer  

### **Skills Demonstrated**
✔ PDA authority models  
✔ CPI security with SPL Token  
✔ Escrow-style account design  
✔ Anchor macros & constraints

## 3. **Invoice Program**
### **What it does**
Issue, pay, and close invoices directly on-chain.

### **Key Responsibilities**
- Created invoice PDA structure  
- Implemented invoice creation & settlement  
- Validated payment flows using CPI  
- Added status tracking (Pending → Paid → Closed)  

### **Skills Demonstrated**
✔ PDA mapping for invoices  
✔ Complex state transitions  
✔ Clean state-model design  
✔ Client-side patterns (Anchor client)  


---

## 4. **Voting dApp (On-Chain Governance)**
### **What it does**
Users create proposals, cast votes, and view outcomes using on-chain logic.

### **Key Responsibilities**
- Designed proposal and vote PDAs  
- Enforced one-vote-per-wallet  
- Time-lock based proposal lifecycle  
- Implemented tally logic  

### **Skills Demonstrated**
✔ Governance program design  
✔ PDA uniqueness constraints  
✔ Safe vote accounting  
✔ Time-based logic on-chain
