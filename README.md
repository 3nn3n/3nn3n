## Summary
**Solana Engineer** passionate about building secure, efficient, and well-architected on-chain programs.  
I focus on PDAs, account security, SPL Token program flows, and writing clean on-chain logic with **Rust + Anchor**.  
I’ve built multiple real Solana programs end-to-end and I’m continuously learning deeper Solana internals.

# Projects

## 1. [**Stake Program**](https://github.com/3nn3n/stake)
### **What it does**
A minimal stake pool where users can deposit tokens and earn proportional rewards. 

---

## 2. [**On-Chain Vault System**](https://github.com/3nn3n/onchain_vault)
### **What it does**
A secure PDA-owned vault where users can deposit/withdraw fungible tokens.


---

## 3. [**Invoice Program**](https://github.com/3nn3n/invoice_platform)
### **What it does**
Issue, pay, and close invoices directly on-chain.


---

## 4. [**Voting dApp (On-Chain Governance)**](https://github.com/3nn3n/solana-voting-dapp)
### **What it does**
Users create proposals, cast votes, and view outcomes using on-chain logic.


---

## 5. [**Minimal Blockchain**](https://github.com/3nn3n/blockchain101)
### **What it does**
A from-scratch blockchain that demonstrates the fundamentals of block creation, hashing, chain validation, and simple P2P synchronization.

---

## 6. [**PBFT Consensus Simulation**](https://github.com/3nn3n/pbft_simulation)
### **What it does**
A step-by-step simulation of **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** showing how nodes:

- Propose  
- Pre-prepare  
- Prepare  
- Commit  

and reach consensus even with faulty nodes.

---

## 7. [**UTXO Ledger (Bitcoin-Style)**](https://github.com/3nn3n/ledger)
### **What it does**
A minimal **UTXO-based ledger** inspired by Bitcoin's transaction model.
